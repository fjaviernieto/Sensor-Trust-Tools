Description: The iotanomdet package implements several solutions and algorithms that analyse data of sensors in the 
    IoT environment with the purpose of detecting anomalies and determining whether the data and the sensors can be
    trusted. It provides some new transformations, a new way to analyse the outcomes from homogeneity tests and a 
    couple of algorithms to analyse variability of the data and to detect outliers.
